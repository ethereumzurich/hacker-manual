# ðŸš‹ ZÃ¼rich Public transport

Trams are the most prevalent form of public transportation in ZÃ¼rich. Electric trams have rumbled through the streets of the city since the late 1800s

To find the tram you need, consult the [Zone 110 (central ZÃ¼rich) tram and bus map](https://www.zvv.ch/zvv-assets/fahrplan/pdf/stadt\_zuerich.pdf). Lines numbered 2 to 17 are trams; those numbered 31 to 916 are buses. If you can manage in German, you can search for routes on the [ZVV mobile app](https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/de/service/apps/ticket-app.html).

**Pricing & options**

* **Single-Ride Tickets:** [Prices](https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/single-ticket.html) depend on how many zones you plan to travel through.
