### EU Roaming

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be aware that Switzerland is **not** part of the EU, nor the EEA, where from June 2017 new international roaming rules are enforced. So roaming rates are not capped or regulated in Switzerland and can be much higher.

European providers treat Switzerland very differently: a few charge the same as within the EU zone, some limit usage in Switzerland, but many add a substantial surcharge on consumptions while roaming in Switzerland. Better check your EU/EEA provider first before use, or buy a local SIM instead.
