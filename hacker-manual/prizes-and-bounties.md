# üèÜ Prizes and bounties

{% hint style="info" %}
We are still working on finalizing the prizes. Final prizes and bounties will be announced at the Opening ceremony at the latest.
{% endhint %}

## General prize pool

### **Open track - quadratic voting**

You decide who wins! Every project is eligible, given they are aligned with [the hackathon themes](../#hackathon-themes) and respecting [the rules](hacking-rules.md). The open track will be judged by everyone attending using their EthereumZuri.ch Soulbound token received upon registration ([more about judging](judging.md)).

* :first\_place: 1st place: $1500
* :second\_place: 2nd place: $1000
* :third\_place: 3nd place: $500

### Judges' favourites

An [IRL jury](judging.md) will be on site to divide $2000 among the top projects. All projects are eligible.

## Sponsor Bounties

You can find all sponsor bounties in [bounties repository](https://github.com/ethereumzurich/sponsor-bounties/issues). The winners of the sponsorship awards and the distribution of prizes are decided by the sponsors themselves.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To be able to get specific bounty, you need to submit your project submission link directly as a comment to the corresponding issue on GitHub.
