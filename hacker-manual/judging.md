  * [**Judges' favourites** ](judging.md#judges-favourites)- The best projects judged by a jury on site.

## Judges' favourites

Traditional style of deciding the winners - judges watch the live pitches of each team and check the project submission asychronously digitally.

Judging will take place on Sunday 16th April and the judges will be reviewing project submissions, and watching pitches, from the 11am deadline until just before the closing ceremony (16:00).

Each team will have one person pitch their project for 3 minutes followed by a 2 minutes Q\&A session. The pitch will be in front of three judges each with different areas of exptertise. The presenter should bring their laptop and use it for the pitch. A schedule will be shared after 11:30 Sunday. Please be there at least 5 minutes before your allocated timeslot.
