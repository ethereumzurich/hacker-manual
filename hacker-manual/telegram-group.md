# ðŸ’¬ Telegram group

We have a special private group on Telegram for confirmed hackers, mentors and other hackathon participants. This is the main communication channel within the hackathon, where you can ask any question about the hackathon or your project ([Mentoring](mentoring/)).

Each hacker received an invitation to the group along with a voucher to pick up a ticket. If you are a confirmed hacker and are not in the group - please contact [@treecz](https://t.me/treecz) .
